                        A fantastic visual tool that streamlines team communication and provides an overview of the current work progress is the Kanban Board. It is also a crucial component of the Kanban method, which aids in the optimization and ongoing improvement of any company process. Your workplace's efficiency will increase and confusion will be eliminated if you visualize your job on a kanban board.

                    <p class="title py-3 pt-5">Here's how a typical Kanban board works: </p>
                    <p >
                        Visualize your workflow: The first step is to map out your workflow and break it down into stages or steps. This could be as simple as "To Do," "Doing," and "Done," or you could create a more detailed workflow with multiple stages.                        
                    </p>

                        <img src="../../../../assets/blogs-thumbnails/KanbanBoardImage.svg" alt="graphs" width="50%" height="25%"> 
                    </span>
                    <p class="py-2 pt-5">
                        Create cards for each task: Each task in your workflow is represented by a card, which includes information such as the task name, description, and due date.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        Move cards through the workflow: As work progresses, team members move their cards through the workflow stages. For example, a card might start in the "To Do" column and move to the "Doing" column when work begins, and then move to the "Done" column when it's completed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        Limit work in progress: Kanban emphasizes limiting the amount of work in progress at any given time to prevent bottlenecks and overburdening team members. This means that each stage of the workflow has a limit on the number of cards that can be in progress at once.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        Continuous improvement: Kanban encourages teams to continuously improve their processes by analyzing their workflow and identifying areas for improvement. This could include reducing cycle time, improving quality, or eliminating waste.
                    </p>
                    <p class="title py-4">How Worktez uses kanban board?</p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        The most basic type of Kanban board is a physical one, where teams utilize sticky notes to represent tasks on a whiteboard (corkboard). Columns are used to symbolize different work phases, and sticky notes are moved from one step to the next.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        Because it is a software solution, a digital Kanban board is far more accessible than a physical one. These kinds of boards can help teams collaborate and give you access to information about the status of your job from nearly anywhere. This digital system gives managers a great deal of flexibility, enabling them to monitor numerous workflows and categorize their employees' work. Many different sectors and teams with a variety of backgrounds have effectively used Kanban boards.
