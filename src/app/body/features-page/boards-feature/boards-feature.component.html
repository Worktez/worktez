<p class="title py-2">Board</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    The board page displays the details of sprint like - start and end dates, progress of the sprint, total tasks, completed tasks and filter to display a specific sprint. The menu button shows the active, backlog and deleted sprints. The tasks button redirects the user to the task page.

<p class="py-2  sub-title">Sprints </p>
<p class="py-2  pb-5 ">
    A sprint is a period of time dedicated to complete a certain amount of time to be completed in the project. The general span of sprint is 2-4 weeks in agile. The active sprint is the current sprint of the project, backlog sprint contains the tasks that are for future reference and are on hold for now and the deleted sprint displays all the deleted tasks. The status button has two options - under progress and completed, which allows us to change the status of the sprint to the selected option.

<p class="py-2  sub-title">Tasks Page</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    The tasks page displays a list of all the tasks of a sprint for the selected team. A single task contains the priority, task ID, task title, assignee, status, difficulty, and progress in an order. The entire details of a task can be displayed by clicking on a single task, which redirects the user to a task details page. The details of the team members can be sorted based on ascending or descending orders of the headers stated.
</p>
<p class="py-2  sub-title">Story Points</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    Story points are metric units used to measure the amount of work needed to finish a product backlog item or any other task. Based on the number, complexity, and uncertainty of the work, the team gives story points. Story points in Agile are abstract measurements that developers use instead of hours. Points are relative values, so a story with a value of four is twice as hard as a story with a value of two. Story points tell you how much effort a given story (task) will take to resolve.

    My dashboard page displays a user performance chart that displays the user performance over the range of sprints based on the story points in the completed tasks and thetasks section contains the list of tasks assigned to the user that are yet to be completed.

    Kanban board is an Agile project management tool used to visualise the flow of work, interpret it and maximise the efficiency of the team. The kanban board contains the task categorised according to their status - ice box, ready to start, under progress, and blocked. Each status is displayed as a column of tasks with their respective status. The tasks can be moved from one status column to another to edit the status of the task.
