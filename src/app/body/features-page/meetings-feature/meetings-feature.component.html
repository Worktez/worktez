    The Meet icon beside the Notification bell icon displays a button “Schedule a Meet” . When clicked, it can be used to schedule a meeting within the application. The “Schedule a Meet”  displays a pop-up to enter the meet information when clicked. The pop-up takes important details like - Meeting title, description, host email(automatically filled with user’s email), attendee’s emails, date, time, team and organisation. After clicking on the button, it will send mails to the attendees with the meet details. Once the user joins the meeting, with a preferred name, they can explore the meeting features.
