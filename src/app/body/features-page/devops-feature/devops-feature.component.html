<p class="title py-2"> DevOps</p>
<p class="py-2 pb-5"> DevOps is a combination of software developers (dev) and operations (ops). It is defined as a software engineering methodology which focuses on integrating the work of software development and software operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.The idea of DevOps is to improve the delivery and development of applications. It means encouraging cultural change, exchanging guidelines, automating repetitive jobs, and putting technologies into place. It involves more than simply placing developers to the same team as their IT operations colleagues.Worktez has its fundamentals in the DevOps methodology, which involves high inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds to collaborate and work together.</p>

<p class="py-2 ">
    It is the mechanism through which applications, modules, updates, and patches are delivered from developers to users.
