<p class="title py-2"> DevOps</p>
<p class="py-2 pb-5"> DevOps is a combination of software developers (dev) and operations (ops). It is defined as a software engineering methodology which focuses on integrating the work of software development and software operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility. The idea of DevOps is to improve the delivery and development of applications. It means encouraging cultural change, exchanging guidelines, automating repetitive jobs, and putting technologies into place. It involves more than simply placing developers to the same team as their IT operations colleagues. Worktez has its fundamentals in the DevOps methodology, which involves high inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds to collaborate and work together.</p>

    It is an automated process that will run one or more jobs. It gets triggered according to the defined schedule. In simple terms, it acts as a visualisation tool to visualise the tasks to be done.

<p class="py-2 sub-title ">Deployment</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    It is the mechanism through which applications, modules, updates, and patches are delivered from developers to users. The methods used by developers to build, test and deploy new code will impact how fast a product can respond to changes in customer preferences or requirements and the quality of each change.
