    The “Tech-tag” page works as a social handle of the user. It displays the posts with basic details about the user's social activity. The right side section contains the recent updates in Worktez which are deployed into the website. <br> The posts contain the star icon which is similar to the “like” reaction in other social media platforms. The “Comments” button displays an extension to the post with a comment box and the comments given the other users to the post. <br> The “Create Post” button allows the user to create a post with either text or media and post it.
