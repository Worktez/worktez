    The “Quick Note” is a floating button in the right bottom corner of the website. The button opens a pop-up when clicked, which allows the users to write a note with any title similar to the notes applications. We also have a create task button in the note, which will create a task with a given title and description when clicked by the user. We can add the task by clicking on ‘+’ icon, edit it by clicking on the note and delete it by clicking on the trash bin icon right to the note.
