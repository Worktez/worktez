    A milestone is a specific point in an Agile project that marks a significant stage of development. It acts as a signpost to help you visualise how much progress has been made and what still needs to be done. The milestones page contains the milestones created to achieve in a certain deadline. We can add tasks to it to complete any specific part of the project and edit the milestone.
