                    <p class="py-2">
                        Agile is an iterative method of project management and software development that allows teams to serve customers more quickly and efficiently. Instead of putting all on a single launch, an agile team will generate discrete but manageable pieces of output.

                    <p class="title py-4">What is DevOps?</p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
